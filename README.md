### My OWn (Self-Built) Weather Forecast App

#### I have decided to build my own version of a weather forecast app (as once again, I cannot and will not take credit for the one we copied in class). The app is using jQuery AJAX methods to retrieve JSON data format files from the Weather Underground API. Then I access the different parts of the returned JSON object to access various information and display it. This project's goal is to practice various methods of retrieving data using AJAX calls to an "outside" server. 

#### Main Areas of Practice:

##### - Making different kinds of AJAX calls
##### - String manipulation (to translate user's input into the formatted query)
##### - Parsing through data & retrieving specific information
##### - Displaying retrieved information.
##### - Retrieve major cities's current forecast, and display on the starting page.
##### - Also, add enable website for international search as well.
