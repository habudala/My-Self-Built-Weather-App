### My OWn (Self-Built) Weather Forecast App

#### I have decided to build my own version of a weather forecast app (as once again, I cannot and will not take credit for the one we copied in class). The app is using jQuery AJAX methods to retrieve JSON data format files from the Weather Underground API. This project's goal is to practice various methods of retrieving data using AJAX calls to an "outside" server.
